Lucene.In.Action.NET
====================

C# port of Lucene In Action Second Edition Sample Code.

## Manning Copyright
The code I ported has the following copyright:

	Copyright Manning Publications Co.

It really does end in the middle of the sentence. It is probably wise to consider any of the code here to be under that license as well. 

## Requirements and Intallation
This isn't some nasty Java, so we don't need these silly classpaths. If you are reading this, you probably have everythign you need (Visual Studio).

## Building and Running

I am not sure yet how I am going to handle this. Probably a set of solution files. We will see.
